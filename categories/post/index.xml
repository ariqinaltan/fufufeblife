A two-story home with two levels of HVAC zoned heating and cooling, one above and one below, will cost around $2,500 to install. Increasing the complexity of the air conditioning zoning system increases the expense. In many circumstances, contractors say, two zones will be adequate, resulting in a lower cost for the HVAC zoning system in the process.
In a similar vein, you could wonder how much it would cost to install a second HVAC zone.</description></item><item><title>Hulk Hogan Posts Work Out Video While Wishing The Rock Happy Birthday</title><link>/hulk-hogan-posts-work-out-video-while-wishing-the-rock-happy-birthday.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hulk-hogan-posts-work-out-video-while-wishing-the-rock-happy-birthday.html</guid><description>Dwayne Johnson turned 47-years-old yesterday, but good news for him is he still looks like The Rock.

だが、米国初の女性副大統領として、また初のアフリカ系びインド系アメリカ人としてアメリカの歴史に名を刻んだハリスのストーリーを辿ってみる価値は大いにある。そこで、いかにハリス副大統領が出世してきたかをチェックしてみよう。
検事補としてキャリアをスタートハワード大学で学位を取得し、カリフォルニア大学ヘイスティングス・ロー・スクールを卒業すると、ハリスはカリフォルニアのアラメダ郡地方検事局に採用された。その後、サンフランシスコ地方検事局に赴任し、サンフランシスコ地方検事に立候補して選出された。
2004年から公職についている2004年から2011年までサンフランシスコ地方検事局で働いた後、2017年に上院議員になるまでカリフォルニア州司法長官を務めた。
サンフランシスコ地方検事時代まで遡って彼女が開示した納税申告書によると、検事としてのキャリアでは、十分な6桁ドルの収入を得ていた（民主党の予備選挙に出馬した際、15年間分の納税申告書を開示）。『Washington Post』紙によると、2014年の結婚前の直近3年間は、年収12万8000ドル（約1400万円）だった。

ダグラス・エムホフとの結婚が彼女の経済状況を大幅に変えたハリスとダグラス・エムホフは2014年に結婚すると夫婦合算で税申告を始め、夫妻の年収は100万ドルを上回ると報じられている。その大部分はエムホフがパートナーとして働いている法律事務所DLA Piperと、その前のVenerableからの収入だ。2018年の夫妻の調整後総所得は189万ドル（約2億円）と報告している。
経済誌『Forbes』によると、2021年6月にハリスの上院議員としての開示書をもとに計算した夫妻の総資産額は推定700万ドル（約10億1000万円）と算出している。
ハリスは本の執筆からかなりの収入を得た『The Truths We Hold』(English Edition)
上院議員としての給与は15万7352ドル（約1700万円）で、カリフォルニア州司法長官時代の収入とそれほど変わらない。しかし、それにプラスして彼女は近年、出版契約から収入を得ている。『Fortune』誌によると、2018年には回顧録『The Truths We Hold』から32万125ドル（約3400万円）を、2019年には出版契約の前払い金として27万7763ドル（約2920万円）を得ている。 Translation: Mitsuko Kanno From Town &amp;amp; Country US
